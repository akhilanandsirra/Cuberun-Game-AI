# Cuberun
Cuberun is a 3-Dimensional endless running game designed and developed using Unity3D.

The player controls a cube that is trying to avoid collision with other obstacles while staying in the path until the destination is reached. While the cube keeps moving forward, the player has to control the cube's position moving it on the platform and avoid colliding with other obstacles. The game is lost if the player hits other obstacles or falls off the platform.

In this project, AI will be demonstrated to teaching a game object on how to play the game using NavMesh in Unity. The game object will be able to clear the game using AI with precision.
